We have already created the class named Car, so now we can use this to create objects.\r\n\r\nTo create an object of Car, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new.", "OnAppearing is a virtual method in the Page base class, that does not contain any code (but that does not mean it does not do anything).\r\n\r\nDepending upon which Page subclass you are using, different things might be performed, like the MasterDetailPage performs logic to determine if it should be displayed as a splitview (side-by-side) mode, the native iOS code would do this on an iPad." };
